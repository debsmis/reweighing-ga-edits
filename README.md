Evolving sample weights for a given dataset and machine learning model using a Genetic Algorithm implemented in Python. Currently supports both lexicase and NSGA-II as parent selection methods.

Steps to produce the plots for different experimental conditions:
1. Execute main() in main.py an appropriate number of times. Put all output files in a folder called 'analysis.'
2. Run the functions in analysis_simple.ipynb to collate the results in 'hv_results' folder.
4. Run simple_plts.R to generate the plots.
